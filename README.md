## Updates

TODO's:

1. Set up global context for server side data, including mdx posts, this data needs to be accessed outside blog page
2. Fix styles across the app
3. Enchance 3D animation, add loading screen, make it even more responsive, so you would be able to resize it and it would make sense showing it on smaller screens
4. Finish up with writing content for the website
5. Finish writing Go backend, for newsletter and email service
6. The website is mobile first, adjust some of the designs to look better on desktop

## Overview

This is the most recent version of my personal site which I am currently building with Next.js, Chakra UI and Storybook.

This project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Running the project locally

- Clone the project locally

From the repo:

### `git clone`

- Installs dependencies required for the app to run in development mode.

On the command line or in the terminal of your preferred editor, you can run:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

- Fire up the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
