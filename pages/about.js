          Thank you for your interest, can't really boast much. I equally enjoy
          doing frontend and backend. Although, that's the way to be lightly
          overwhelmed. I would mainly describe myself as a frontend developer. I
          have extensive experience working with javascript ecosystem. And I try
          to learn something new everyday. Apart from some of my graphics
          experiments I learn Go and everything about designing systems for the
          robust web applications.

          I studied Multimedia Computing at Brooklyn College from 2016-2020 and
          have since been working part-time jobs to pay for the college. I
          developed a passion for writing code back in college when I was
          Engineering major taking a C++ course. And interest, when I was
          solving math problems with Pascal in 6th grade, as I've never actually
          enjoyed doing math on my own.

          I've been focused on building React applications, diving deeper into
          React itself, libraries and tools surrounding it. At the moment I'm
          trying to get better at testing, optimizing performance and
          typescript. I'm passionate about WASM, GO & Rust. I want to learn more
          about databases and product management.
