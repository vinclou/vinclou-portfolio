          Thank you for your interest, can't really boast much. I had recently graduated
          and trying to figure out where do I go in life; and what do I do professionally.
          In WebDev I equally enjoy doing frontend and backend.
          Although, that's the way to be lightly overwhelmed, I still
          try to focus more on the frontend.

          I studied Multimedia Computing at Brooklyn College from 2016-2020 and
          have since been working part-time jobs to pay for the college. I
          developed a passion for writing code back in college when I was
          Engineering major taking a C++ course. And interest, when I was
          solving math problems with Pascal in 6th grade, as I've never actually
          enjoyed doing math on my own {`;)`}

          I've been focused on building React applications, diving deeper into
          React itself, libraries and tools surrounding it. At the
          moment I'm trying to get better at testing, optimizing
          performance and typescript. I'm passionate about WASM, GO & Rust,
          because it makes so much more sense than working with C++ or Java,
          I want to learn more about databases where I'm lacking proficiency.
