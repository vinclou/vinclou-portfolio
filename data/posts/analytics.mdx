## INTRO

<br />

So, you are thinking about adding analytics in your app but are not sure,
what is going to be your best option. Some of the options are paid, some are free.
Google doesn't seem to be attractive to you.

<br />

You should really look into [counter.dev](https://counter.dev/)

<br />

You can also check out their [github](https://github.com/ihucos/counter.dev)

<br />

It's an open source project, they don't collect personal data,
as well as host their own service, although it is totally
possible to fork it and host it on your own.

Although I don't think it worth the trouble.

<SectionWrapper title="counter.dev what does it offer">

## Counter.dev

#### What does it do?

<br />

They offer you a very simple tracking solution, which is able to do
two things

- You can see which other websites, social media, or blogs link to
  your website.

- Also, it let you count your daily visitors, their languages and device types

<br />

</SectionWrapper>

<SectionWrapper title="second">

## Setting up in NextJS is a breeze!

#### Well setting it up anywhere will be a breeze

<br />

Here's what you should insert into you custom \_document.js inside Next Head.

```javascript
<script
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `if(!sessionStorage.getItem("_swa")&&document.referrer.indexOf(location.protocol+"//"+location.host)!== 0){fetch("https://counter.dev/track?"+new URLSearchParams({referrer:document.referrer,screen:screen.width+"x"+screen.height,user:"vinclou",utcoffset:"-5"}))};sessionStorage.setItem("_swa","1");`
  }}
></script>
```

##### You will get your own tracking script, right after you make an account.

## Conclusion

#### Subscribe to my newsletter, to get notified about new blogs

<br />

Beware [Counter.dev](https://counter.dev/) wouldn't be a good solution for
you if you need thorough analytics.

<br />

It can be easily blocked by an ad blocker, as this is privacy
first solution and I do not think they will ever change their
approach to the way they do business.

<br />

I still urge you to check it out, it's an open source project and
you can always fork it, add the extras which will suit your needs.
And what you really need to ask yourself, how much of analytics I really need?
For most of the use cases, you want a simple tool that is easily manageable.

<br />

Most of us are busy with our life's and jobs. There's little time to waste
on google's bloat or paid solutions which will give you a headache due
to a learning curve.

<br />

This the end, my dear friend. Do not for get to subscribe. ðŸ”¨
