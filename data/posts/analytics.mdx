## There are many options

#### And most of them provide more than you actually need

So, you are thinking about adding analytics in your app but are not sure,
what is going to be your best option. Some of the options are paid, some are free.
Google doesn't seem to be attractive to you.

<br />

You should look into [counter.dev](https://counter.dev/),
here's the [github](https://github.com/ihucos/counter.dev) page.

<br />

It's an open source project, privacy focused solution, they do not collect any user data,
but they do provide a hosted solution to see your analytics results.
And it's totally possible to fork it and host it on your own.

<br />

Although I don't think it worth the trouble.

## Counter.dev

#### What does it do?

<br />

They offer you a very simple tracking solution, which is able to do
two things

- You can see which other websites, social media, or blogs link to
  your website.

- Also, it let you count your daily visitors, their languages and device types

## Setting it up in NextJS is a breeze!

#### Well setting it up anywhere will be a breeze

<br />

Here's what you should insert into you custom \_document.js inside Next Head.

##### You will get your own tracking script, right after you make an account.

```javascript
<script
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `if(!sessionStorage.getItem("_swa")&&document.referrer.indexOf(location.protocol+"//"+location.host)!== 0){fetch("https://counter.dev/track?"+new URLSearchParams({referrer:document.referrer,screen:screen.width+"x"+screen.height,user:"vinclou",utcoffset:"-5"}))};sessionStorage.setItem("_swa","1");`
  }}
></script>
```

<SectionWrapper title="Conclusion - counter.dev">

## Conclusion

#### Counter.dev is a nice tool, for someone who is looking to provide private and simple tracking

<br />

Proceed with caution as,
[Counter.dev](https://counter.dev/) wouldn't be a good solution for
you if you need thorough analytics.

<br />

It can be easily blocked by an ad blocker, as it's privacy
first solution and it's not going to change.

<br />

I still urge you to check it out, it's an open source project,
you can always fork it, add the extras which will suit your needs.
And what you really need to ask yourself, `how much of analytics I really need?`
For the rest of us, a simple tool that is easily manageable is to-go option.

<br />

We are busy people after all. There's little time to waste
on google's unwelcoming UI and privacy concerns
or paid solutions which probably won't bring much to a hobby project.
