## Choosing a way to manage content can be challenging.

#### All of them will solve your problem in one way or another.

First, [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is an extension of Markdown that allows you to import and use custom React components.
The best thing about MDX is that it lets you have truly custom components,
and you're able to do much more than with markdown or any CMS.

<br />

When using Markdown in a web application, there's a "compile" step; the Markdown needs to be transformed into HTML,
so that it can be understood by the browser.

<br />

This is great, but it means we're limited to a handful of HTML elements that Markdown is aware of.

<br />

MDX takes the format a step further, and allows us to include our own elements, in the form of React components:

<br />

`These are the best libraries to work with MDX:`

- [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler)
- [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote)

<br />

If aren't using NextJS I would recommend to tinker with MDX bundler instead.

<SectionWrapper title="counter.dev what does it offer">

## MDX is cool and all, but there are caveats

#### What does it do?

<br />

They offer you a very simple tracking solution, which is able to do
two things

- You can see which other websites, social media, or blogs link to
  your website.

- Also, it let you count your daily visitors, their languages and device types

<br />

## Setting it up in NextJS is a breeze!

#### Well setting it up anywhere will be a breeze

<br />

Here's what you should insert into you custom \_document.js inside Next Head.

##### You will get your own tracking script, right after you make an account.

```javascript
<script
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `if(!sessionStorage.getItem("_swa")&&document.referrer.indexOf(location.protocol+"//"+location.host)!== 0){fetch("https://counter.dev/track?"+new URLSearchParams({referrer:document.referrer,screen:screen.width+"x"+screen.height,user:"vinclou",utcoffset:"-5"}))};sessionStorage.setItem("_swa","1");`
  }}
></script>
```

## Just glimpse over their UI

<br />
<Grid>
  <GridElement w="100%">
    <NextImg
      alt="dashboard-1"
      src="/static/images/analytics/dashboard-1.png"
      objectFit="scale-down"
      ratio={16 / 9}
    />

  </GridElement>
  <GridElement>
    <NextImg
      alt="dashboard-1"
      src="/static/images/analytics/dashboard-2.png"
      objectFit="scale-down"
      ratio={16 / 9}
    />
  </GridElement>
  <GridElement>
    <NextImg
      alt="dashboard-1"
      src="/static/images/analytics/dashboard-3.png"
      objectFit="scale-down"
      ratio={16 / 9}
    />
  </GridElement>
  <GridElement>
    <NextImg
      alt="dashboard-1"
      src="/static/images/analytics/dashboard-4.png"

<SectionWrapper title="Conclusion - counter.dev">

## Conclusion

#### Counter.dev is a nice tool, for someone who is looking to provide private and simple tracking

<br />

Proceed with caution as,
[Counter.dev](https://counter.dev/) wouldn't be a good solution for
you if you need thorough analytics.

<br />

It can be easily blocked by an ad blocker, as it's privacy
first solution and it's not going to change.

<br />

I still urge you to check it out, it's an open source project,
you can always fork it, add the extras which will suit your needs.
And what you really need to ask yourself, `how much of analytics I really need?`
For the rest of us, a simple tool that is easily manageable is to-go option.

<br />

We are busy people after all. There's little time to waste
on google's unwelcoming UI and privacy concerns
or paid solutions which probably won't bring much to a hobby project.
