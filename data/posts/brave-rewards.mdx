## INTRO

So, you are thinking about adding analytics in your app but are not sure,
what is going to be your best option. Some of the options are paid, some are free.

But what you really need to ask yourself, how much of analytics I really need,
if you are making a hobby website/blog, maybe all you want to do is track visitors,
without and bloat javascript bundles from google or anywhere else.
And maybe write a few custom functions to handle edge cases, you really want to track.
