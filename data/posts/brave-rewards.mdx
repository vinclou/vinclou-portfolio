## Brave?

#### Honestly, it's the future

<br />

I've discovered Brave about two years ago and began actively using it
after I saw a Lex's podcast with Brendan Eich, the founder of Brave.
If you have a little time click this link, to skip right to the solution.

<br />
And it's an awesome browser really, but their rewards system is a seamless way to
tip the creators of the content you love. It's easy, doesn't require much configuration
for the Brave user and some of the BAT is earned by user for seeing the ads. I am
a madman to say such a thing, but for the first time in my life, I don't have deep
aversion to ads, as I always do outside Brave's ecosystem.
<br />
You would be a fool for not adding it to your medium channels. Although, of course
the user base is not a contender to Chrome/Safari/Firefox for now.
<br />
Yet, as times change, users will follow.

## The Problem

#### You have probably stumbled upon this blog post for a reason

I suppose you have tried doing this:

- Create and verify Uphold wallet to receive BAT tokens
- Create an account for Brave Rewards â€“ Creators
- Claim your platforms

And here's the problem you are adding .well-known folder, containing
your brave-rewards-certification.txt, you deploy your HEAD commit and you don't
see any change in the status, it is still saying that you are not verified.
You move folder around, check if you named it correctly still, doesn't help.
Confused you google for the solutions and there are none. I mean you put this
folder in public dir, where else could it possibly go in a NextJS project.

What happened?

Honestly, I would like to know that too. It surely said that's the easiest way to get
verified. I was going to contact Brave directly and ask where the file should be located,
but I found out it is much easier to modify your DNS record and not worry about any
of that to verify your web site.

Simply go to your DNS records, on Vercel and Netlify it's pretty much the same process,
here are the links to docs
[Vercel DNS](https://vercel.com/support/articles/how-to-manage-vercel-dns-records)
[Netlify DNS](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/netlify-dns/dns-records/)

But I'm sure they are pretty much the same for any provider.

To edit the existing DNS Records of your Domain or add new ones,
navigate to the Domains page of your Project Settings.
There, click Edit on the Domain of your choice and you'll find a link at the bottom of the view.

The last step would be adding TXT record with [TTL](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/time-to-live-ttl/) around 1 - 3 days.
