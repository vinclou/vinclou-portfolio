## Brave?

#### Honestly, it's the future

<br />

[Click to skip the intro](#the-problem).

<br />

I've discovered Brave about two years ago, but began actively using it
after I saw a Lex's podcast with [Brendan Eich](https://brendaneich.com/)
the founder of Brave, co-founder of Mozilla and JavaScript creator.

<br />

It's an awesome browser, and I love the rewards system they have implemented,
essentially Brave offers:

- A seamless way to tip the creators of the content you love.
- Security and privacy features right out of the box.
  (having Tor without Tor is cool, not claiming it's bulletproof)
- An easy way to earn a few dollars on a side from seeing ads, without them being intrusive.
- And all other features

I believe, at some point, it will be on the list of the most used browsers,
just like Chrome/Firefox/Safari.

<br />

I even use it for development, it has Chrome dev tools, but does not drain my battery and cpu
like Chrome does.

<br />

I am a madman to say such a thing, but for the first time in my life, I don't have deep
aversion to ads, as I always do anywhere else on the web.

<br />

It's not all sunshine and roses, there are many things they should improve on.
Nevertheless, I do consider Brave a worth while experience.
I'll leave my criticism for another time.

## Problem

#### You have stumbled upon this blog post for a reason

And I suppose you have tried doing this:

- Create and verify Uphold wallet to receive BAT tokens
- Create an account for Brave Rewards â€“ Creators
- Claim your platforms, specifically website option

<br />

You tried adding it through the recommend way, which involves
adding .well-known folder with the txt file they give you. In my
case I put it inside my public folder in NextJS app; after a day
of waiting and a day of trying to find a solution why I couldn't
verify my platform. I gave up and tried adding a DNS record.

<br />

##### What happened?

I wish I knew, it certainly said that's the easiest way to get started.

<br />

I was going to contact Brave directly and ask if I was doing everything
the way it supposed to work. Yet, adding DNS was a five minute venture
and I quickly forgot about as the problem went away.

## Solution

#### Just add brave-rewards through DNS records, in fact that's the easiest way

<br />

Simply go to your DNS records, on Vercel and Netlify it's pretty much the same process,
here are the links to the docs, that explain in detail where you find the control panel
for DNS. Yet, I'm sure the process is more or less the same for every provider.

- [Vercel DNS](https://vercel.com/support/articles/how-to-manage-vercel-dns-records)
- [Netlify DNS](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/netlify-dns/dns-records/)

<br />

To edit the existing DNS Records of your Domain or add new ones:

1. Navigate to the Domains page of your Project Settings.
2. Click edit on the domain of your choice, you'll find a link at the bottom of the view.
3. The last step would be adding TXT record with [TTL](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/time-to-live-ttl/)
   value around 1 - 3 days.

<br />

This is pretty much it, you are done.
Click verify at [brave rewards creators](https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/).
Go to your website and check verification badge. It should say you are a verified creator now!
