<SectionWrapper title="update one, what am I doing">

I continue working on my [blog](vincentarlou.com).
I also started working on a new project called ProjectInit/

<br />

I hope it will greatly improve people's ability to start or find a side project for
yourself.

<br />

During that experience, I learned a lot more about NextJS and React, I continue grasping
`Go` and working on a simple http server connected to DynamoDB to handle newsletter
subscriptions and emails.

<br />

I think this goes without saying, there's so much more coming.
